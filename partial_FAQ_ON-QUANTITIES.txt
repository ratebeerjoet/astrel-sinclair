Target Body
Refers to the object of interest for which an ephemeris is to be created. Selected by the user. It can be a major-body or small-body.

Center (or coordinate origin, or observering location)
This is the point to which output quantities for the target (such as coordinates) are referred: (0,0,0). It is typically where the observer is located.

An observation point is “topocentric” if on the surface of a body with a known rotational state.

If at the center of a physical body, the observing point is “bodycentric” (with “geocentric” referring to the particular case of origin at the Earth’s center).

If at the center-of-mass of some dynamical system, the center or observer is “barycentric”.


3. Observer table
Overview and usage:

The output values in observer tables are “as seen” by an observer, being compensated for aberrations such as light-time and other significant perspective-dependent effects.

Observer tables may be produced for any target object as seen by an observer from topocentric coordinates on or at the center of a major body (planet, natural satellite, spacecraft, and some asteroids) with a defined rotation model.

Targets can also be specified as surface coordinates on another major body, such as a crater.

Default quantities that are always present in an observer table: include

Time Universal Time (UT) or Terrestrial Time (TT) output timescales can be selected

Solar-presence symbol Indicates dawn and twilight conditions, and if the Sun’s limb is above or below the local horizon)

Lunar-presence Indicates if the Moon’s limb is above or below the local horizon

Additional user-selectable quantities are output in the order selected. The desired output quantities must be specified at least once. No initial default output exists in telnet or e-mail interfaces.

… or select a pre-defined alphabetic macro below:

       A = All quantities
       B = Bodycentric observer -> Any target
       C = Body-center observer -> Small-body target
       D = Topocentric observer -> Small-body target
       E = Bodycentric observer -> Spacecraft target
       F = Topocentric observer -> Spacecraft target
The alphabetic short-cut macros specifically include these quantities:

       A = 1-48
       B = 1-3, 6, 9-33, 36-41, 43-46, 47
       C = 1-3, 9-11, 13, 18-29, 33, 36-41, 43-46, 47
       D = 1-5, 8-10, 11, 13, 18-29, 33-34, 36-48
       E = 1-3, 8, 10, 18-25, 29, 41, 43-47
       F = 1-5, 8, 10, 18-25, 29, 41-48
… with the macros for small-body cases (C and D) primarily skipping cartographic dependent quantities. Note that some small bodies (such as Ida, Gaspra, Eros, etc.) are exceptions, having IAU-defined mapping grids. For such special cases, options C & D won’t provide all available data.

“n.a.” is output in the ephemeris if a requested quantity is not available for a selected target object. The alphabetic macro codes are intended to help reduce the appearance of “n.a.” symbols in the final output. For example, when azimuth and elevation are requested for a geocentric ephemeris, or orbital uncertainies for an object without a covariance, these quantities will always be undefined and return an “n.a.” if requested.

Some quantities, such as apparent visual magnitude (#9), may display values in the ephemeris output, but then switch to “n.a.” if moving outside the range of valid calculation. For example, if the phase angle becomes high enough that the magnitude model ceases to be accurate, numeric values will not be output and the “n.a.” marker will be output instead.

The ‘*’ symbols in the quantity list above indicate quantities affected by user selection of airless or refraction-correction. Refraction correction, if requested, is available only for Earth (or body-centered observers, for which the refraction is zero since all directions are zenith). “n.a’ will be returned for all other observers.

The ‘>’ symbol above marks small-body statistical quantities computable when a covariance matrix is available in the database or supplied by users. If such a quantity is requested but no statistical propagation is available for the object, the “n.a.” symbol will be output.

In the list below, ‘*’ indicates initial program default for observer table OPTION settings:

4. Close-approach table (small-bodies ONLY)
Overview and usage:

Requesting this table type (via telnet or e-mail) activates monitoring of close-approaches by the small-body target to the planets and 16 most massive asteroid perturbers. This table is not available for major body targets, only comets and asteroids numerically integrated by Horizons.

Each time an encounter minimum distance with one of the 25 objects is detected, one-line of information is generated to summarize the encounter conditions.

Close-approach detection limits that trigger output can be changed by users, but the default values are:
    Other small-bodies (i.e., the set of 16 large perturbing asteroids)

      0.10 au

    Planetary bodies

      Merc  Venu  Eart  Mars  Jupi  Satu  Nept  Uran  Plut  Moon
      ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  -----
      0.10  0.10  0.10  0.10  1.00  1.00  1.00  1.00  0.10  0.003

  To change these values, input a comma-separated list of values (when
  prompted) up to the last one of interest. For example, to change the
  Earth encounter limit from 0.1 au to 0.2 au, enter:

      0.1, 0.1, 0.2

  The values of Mercury and Venus will remain 0.1 au, but the value for
  the third entry, Earth, will be changed to 0.2 au.
Table generation will be automatically cut-off early if the 3-sigma statistical uncertainty in the time of the encounter exceeds a default value of +/- 14400 minutes (+/- 10 days). Users can change this limit.

Users may also toggle output of extended output lines for detected encounters. This provides additional statistical information on the encounter. See the section on “Close Approach Tables” below, for a detailed explanation of the output.

Definition of Observer Table Quantities
The detailed description of the selectable observer table quantities follows. “Labels” refers to column headings at the start of the output table.

Time
One output line for each step. The line begins with a ‘b’ if the date is BC, a blank (“ “) if AD. This is followed by the date and time, which is either UT or TT, in calendar or JD format (or both), depending on user defaults.

Time tags refer to the time-scale conversion from TDB on Earth regardless of observer location within the solar system, although clock rates may differ due to the local gravity field and no analogous time-scales are locally defined.

Solar Presence
Time tag is followed by a blank, then a solar-presence symbol that indicates twilight and dawn conditions also:

    '*'  Daylight (refracted solar upper-limb on or above apparent horizon)
    'C'  Civil twilight/dawn
    'N'  Nautical twilight/dawn
    'A'  Astronomical twilight/dawn
    ' '  Night OR geocentric ephemeris
Lunar/Interfering Body Presence
The solar presence symbol is immediately followed by an “interfering body” presence symbol (which will indicate the Moon for Earth observers):

    'm'  Refracted upper-limb of Moon (or interfering body, 'i') is on or above
          apparent horizon
    ' '  Refracted upper-limb of Moon (or interfering body) is below the
          apparent horizon, or geocentric ephemeris

The lunar/IB presence marker (an ongoing state) can be over-ridden by a target
event marker if an event has occurred since the last output step:

    'r'  Rise          (target body on or above cut-off RTS elevation)
    'e'  Elevation max (target body maximum elevation angle has occurred)
    't'  Transit       (target body at or passed through observer meridian)
    's'  Set           (target body on or below cut-off RTS elevation)
The ‘rets’ codes will be displayed under two conditions only: if the print interval is less than or equal to 30 minutes or the RTS-only print option has been selected.

For non-Earth observing sites, no twilight/dawn codes (C, N, or A) are output, refraction is not modeled and the interfering body marker is ‘i’ instead of the ‘m’ reserved for Earth’s Moon.

Statistical Uncertainties
Output for asteroids and comets can include formal +/- 3-standard-deviation statistical orbit uncertainty quantities. There is a 99.7% chance the actual value is within given bounds. These statistical calculations assume observational data errors are random. If there are systematic biases (such as measurement timing, reduction, or star-catalog errors), results can be optimistic. Because the epoch covariance is mapped using linearized variational partial derivatives, results can also be optimistic for times far from the solution epoch, particularly for objects having close planetary encounters.

NOTE: “n.a.” is output if a requested quantity is not available for selected object. For example, azimuth and elevation for a geocentric ephemeris, or uncertainties for an object with no covariance in the database.

Specific Quantities
1. Astrometric RA & DEC
Adjusted for light-time aberration only. With respect to the reference
plane and equinox of the chosen system (ICRF or FK4/B1950). If the
FK4/B1950 frame output is selected, elliptic aberration terms are added.
Astrometric RA/DEC is generally used when comparing or reducing data
against a star catalog.

        Labels:  R.A._____(ICRF)_____DEC  (HMS/DMS format)
                 R.A.__(FK4/B1950)___DEC  (HMS/DMS format)
                 R.A.___(ICRF)___DEC      (degree format)
                 R.A_(FK4/B1950)_DEC      (degree format)
2. Apparent RA & DEC
Apparent right ascension and declination of the target with respect to
the specified observing center/site. "Apparent" can have three different
meanings, depending on where the observer is located:

A) For EARTH-BASED sites

   Apparent coordinates are with respect to the true-equator and Earth
   equinox of-date coordinate system (EOP-corrected IAU76/80 precession
   and nutation of the spin-pole) and adjusted to model light-time, the
   gravitational deflection of light, and stellar aberration, with an
   optional (approximate) correction for atmospheric yellow-light
   refraction.

   Apparent RA/DEC for Earth-based sites is generally used when physically
   aligning a telescope on the surface with the equator and pole of-date.

B) For NON-EARTH SITES WITHOUT ROTATIONAL MODELS

   Apparent RA and DEC are with respect to the REFERENCE FRAME coordinate
   system (ICRF or FK4/B1950), but still adjusted for light-time, the
   gravitational deflection of light and stellar aberration.

C) For NON-EARTH SITES WITH ROTATIONAL MODELS

   The origin of RA is the meridian containing the reference frame Earth
   equinox (ICRF or FK4/B1950) with the X-Y equator plane defined by the
   IAU rotational model. Adjusted for light-time, gravitational deflection
   of light, and stellar aberration.  No refraction model is available.

        Labels:  R.A._(a-apparent)__DEC.  (airless, HMS-DMS format)
                 R.A._(r-apparent)__DEC.  (refracted, HMS-DMS format)
                 R.A._(a-appar)_DEC.      (airless, decimal degrees format)
                 R.A._(r-appar)_DEC.      (refracted, decimal degrees format)
3. Rates: RA & DEC
The angular rate of change in aparent RA and DEC of the target. This is
with respect to the non-inertial IAU76/80 Earth true equator and equinox
of-date reference frame. d(RA)/dt is multiplied by the cosine of
declination to provide a linear rate in the plane-of-sky.

  Units: ARCSECONDS PER HOUR.

  Labels:  dRA*cosD d(DEC)/dt
4. Apparent azimuth & elevation (AZ-EL) :
Apparent azimuth and elevation of target. Adjusted for light-time,
the gravitational deflection of light, stellar aberration, precession and
nutation. There is an optional (approximate) adjustment for atmospheric
refraction (Earth only). Azimuth is measured clockwise from north:

  North(0) -> East(90) -> South(180) -> West(270)

Elevation angle is with respect to plane perpendicular to local zenith
direction.  TOPOCENTRIC ONLY.

  Units: DEGREES

  Labels:  Azi____(a-app)___Elev  (airless)
           Azi____(r-app)___Elev  (refracted)
5. Rates: azimuth and elevation (AZ-EL))
The rate of change of target apparent azimuth and elevation (airless).
d(AZ)/dt is multiplied by the cosine of the elevation angle. TOPOCENTRIC
ONLY.

  Units: ARCSECONDS PER MINUTE

  Labels:  dAZ*cosE d(ELV)/dt
6. X & Y satellite offset & position angle
Satellite apparent differential coordinates in the plane-of-sky with
respect to the primary body along with the satellite position angle.
Differential coordinates are defined in RA as:

   `X= ((RA_sat - RA_primary) * cosine(DEC_primary))`

... and in DEC as:

   `Y= (DEC_sat - DEC_primary)`

Non-lunar satellites only. "SatPANG" is the counter-clockwise (CCW)
position angle from the reference-frame of-date north-pole to a line
from the primary center to the satellite center.

  Units: ARCSECONDS (X & Y) and DEGREES (position angle)

  Labels:  X_(sat-primary)_Y SatPANG
7. Local Apparent Sidereal Time
The angle measured westward in the body true-equator of-date plane
from the meridian containing the body-fixed observer to the meridian
containing the true Earth equinox (defined by intersection of the true
equator of date with the ecliptic of date).  TOPOCENTRIC ONLY.

  Units are HH MM SS.ffff or decimal hours (HH.ffffffffff)

  Labels:  L_Ap_Sid_Time
